1. The first step we did is to make sure that we have VScode installed on our computers<br /><img width="1440" alt="Untitled" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122485099/211921441-9caf3397-6295-4026-a2f3-3e148cbd7366.png"> <br />
2. The second step we do is to change our password for the CSE15L account, we just need to follow the steps which the course has already provided<br />
In this situation, we usually need to wait couple of minutes during the process<br />
3. After changing our passwords, we need to go to the terminal and connect our laptops to the server, and when we finish that, we can see the screen just like the screenshot I took.<br />
Here are several steps during the process:<br />
1)Type "$ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu" in the terminal, which I typed xpang@ieng6.ucsd.edu into my terminal<br />
2)Then we type "yes"<br />
3)Type our password we just changed and everything will work<br />

4. The last step is to put in some commands and see if it works, and the screenshot is the picture below<br />
In this case, you can try different things: ls, cd, ls -lat and so on...<br />
